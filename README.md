- Work with an external API that requires an API key and token to receive data
- Learn and implement Tailwind CSS
- Create personas and user stories for a targeted audience 
- Build an app that is responsive across mobile, tablet and desktop sizes
- Ability for users to store/manipulate the data displayed in the app
```

### User Stories
```
Users should be able to:
- Browse through the available pets
- Click on a pet and get more information
- Narrow their search down to location, and see pets that are near them
- See error pages/messages if there are no pets available in the area
```
